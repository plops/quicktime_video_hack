state "Device Idle" as Idle
state "Waiting for Ping" as WaitPing
state "Streaming" as Streaming
state "Stopping" as Stopping

[*] --> Idle
Idle --> WaitPing : Host connects to USB Endpoint
WaitPing --> Streaming : Device sends PING, Host replies with PING
Streaming --> Stopping : Host sends HPA0 and HPD0
Stopping --> Idle : Device sends RELS for both ClockRefs

Streaming : Exchanges audio and video data
Streaming : Exchanging Sync packets for clock synchronization

state Streaming {
  state "Exchanging Audio ClockRefs" as AudioClock
  state "Exchanging Video ClockRefs" as VideoClock
  state "Clock Synchronization" as ClockSync
  
  [*] --> AudioClock
  AudioClock --> VideoClock : Device sends CWPA, Host replies with local clock
  VideoClock --> ClockSync : Device sends CVRP, Host replies with local clock
  ClockSync --> AudioClock : Device sends SYNC packets (AFMT, CLOK, TIME, SKEW)

This diagram represents the state machine of the communication protocol between the host and the iOS device for screen mirroring. 

Here's a breakdown of the states:

* **Device Idle:** The initial state, where the device is not streaming.
* **Waiting for Ping:** Host has connected to the USB endpoint and is waiting for the initial ping from the device.
* **Streaming:** The active state where audio and video data are exchanged alongside synchronization messages. 
    * **Exchanging Audio ClockRefs:**  Host and device exchange clock references for audio synchronization.
    * **Exchanging Video ClockRefs:**  Host and device exchange clock references for video synchronization.
    * **Clock Synchronization:** Host and device exchange various SYNC packets (AFMT, CLOK, TIME, SKEW) for ongoing clock synchronization.
* **Stopping:** The host has initiated the shutdown by sending HPA0 and HPD0, waiting for the device to acknowledge and release resources.

The transitions indicate how the protocol moves between these states based on messages exchanged. 

This is a simplified representation, and the actual implementation may have more states or transitions to handle errors and corner cases.
