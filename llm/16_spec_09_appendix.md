### 9.2 Implementation Notes

* **Clock Implementation:** 
    * Clocks should be monotonic and have nanosecond precision.
    * Avoid using wall clock time for timing calculations.
* **Skew Adjustment:** 
    * Skew adjustment should be applied gradually to avoid sudden jumps in playback speed.
* **Error Handling:**
    * Implement robust error handling mechanisms to recover from unexpected conditions.
    * Consider using timeouts for waiting for responses.
* **Endianness:**
    * All multi-byte values are encoded in little-endian format.
* **Data Alignment:**
    * Ensure proper data alignment when parsing and serializing data structures.

### 9.3 Best Practices

* **Buffer Management:**
    * Use appropriately sized buffers for receiving and sending data.
    * Implement buffer pooling to reduce memory allocation overhead.
* **Threading:**
    * Use separate threads for USB communication and data processing to avoid blocking the main thread.
* **Logging:**
    * Implement logging to facilitate debugging and troubleshooting.
* **Testing:**
    * Write comprehensive unit tests to verify the correctness of your implementation.
    * Use the provided packet dumps as test fixtures.

### 9.4 Future Extensions and Considerations

* **Support for Additional Codecs:**
    * Extend the protocol to support other video and audio codecs beyond H.264 and LPCM.
* **Improved Error Reporting:**
    * Define more specific error codes to provide better feedback to the user.
* **Security Enhancements:**
    * Consider implementing security measures to protect the communication channel.
* **Performance Optimizations:**
    * Explore techniques to reduce latency and improve streaming performance.
