Note that the documentation and code in this folder was produced by an AI.
In particular the Large Language Model Gemini 1.5 Pro by Google.

I loaded existing documentation and code of the Go project into Gemini and asked it to produce the outputs.

I have not yet verified correctness (and might never do that).
